This tool finds the cheapest pizza in all of the land (◠﹏◠)

### What?
Well, kinda. I like all kinds of pizza and I'm not fussy where it's from, as long as there's a good deal I'm happy.
This tool scrapes data from the bigger chains in my area and shows me which chain is currently doing the best deal.

### Is this a good idea?
Probably not, but I'll go gym later.

### Can I use it?
Yeah, go for it.

### How?
Just download and execute the release binary, fill out the form and wait for your result.
